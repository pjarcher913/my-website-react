#### Hello! You are viewing the codebase for the ReactJS version of my personal website.

As with all other websites, `index.html` is used to initially load. If you don't want to go through the process of deploying the build to a server, simply clone this repo and then open `index.html`. You will be able to get a feel for how everything looks and runs.

This site is not publicly-hosted at this time. However, it is fully functional and can be deployed locally after cloning by using `npx serve` or any other method of quickly starting a web service.  
***NOTE:** `npx` requires `npm` to be installed to execute.*
