#### Hello! You are viewing the codebase for the ReactJS version of my personal website.

I developed and designed this site using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

This site is not publicly-hosted at this time. However, it is fully functional and can be deployed locally after cloning by using `npx serve` or any other method of quickly starting a web service.  
***NOTE:** `npx` requires `npm` to be installed to execute.*
